                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>⅓ cup shortening</li>
                <li>½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives</li>

            <h2>Steps: </h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). </li>
                <li> Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Cut in shortening with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir Cheddar cheese and chives into flour mixture; gradually stir in milk to form a soft dough. </li>
                <li> Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and with floured hands, knead until smooth, about 15 times. Roll dough out to a 1-inch thickness with a floured rolling pin. Cut biscuits with a 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter; place onto an ungreased baking sheet. Press dough trimmings together, roll out again, and cut remaining dough into rounds. </li>
                <li> Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. </li>
            </ol>
