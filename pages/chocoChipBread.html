            <h2> Ingredients: </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Flour: This chocolate chip banana bread starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
                <li>Leaveners: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the bread rise. </li>
                <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip banana bread, but it won't make it taste salty.</li>
                <li>Bananas: You'll need to mash three ripe bananas.</li>
                <li>Milk: A tablespoon of milk adds moisture.</li>
                <li>Cinnamon: Ground cinnamon lends welcome warmth.</li>
                <li>Sugar: This recipe calls for white sugar, but some Allrecipes community members like to use a blend of brown and white sugars.</li>
                <li>Eggs: Whole eggs keep the banana bread moist and help bind the batter together.</li>
                <li>Chocolate chips: Of course, you'll need chocolate chips!</li>
            </ul>
